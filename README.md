# World-Development-Indicators-Dashboard

## Description:
World Development Indicators Dashboard visualizes global development metrics using Dash by Plotly. It contains interactive charts and map for exploring key indicators such as GDP per capita, life expectancy, population density etc. across countries.

## Key Features

- **Interactive Visualizations**: Explore dynamic charts and maps that illustrate trends in various development indicators over time and across regions.
- **Customizable Analysis**: Select specific countries and indicators of interest to analyze their development trajectories.
- **Design**: User-friendly interface.


## Usage

- **Select Indicators**: Use dropdowns to select indicators such as GDP, population density, life expectancy, etc.
- **Explore Maps and Charts**: Interact with choropleth maps, line charts, and bar graphs to visualize data trends.
- **Adjust Filters**: Use sliders and radio buttons to filter data by year, region, and more.

## Technologies Used:
- **Python**
- **Dash by Plotly**
- **Plotly** for interactive visualizations
- **Pandas** for data manipulation
- **CSS** for styling

## Dataset
Interpolated and Imputated files:
"The original dataset contains an extreme amount of missing values. To battle that, the author provided the following two datasets:"

### Interpolated data¶
"In the Interpolated Dataset, data points were not merely filled but contextually enriched using conditional interpolation methods, ensuring the integrity of time series and the authenticity of trends."

### Imputated data¶
Imputation Method

"The Final Imputed Dataset benefits from kNN imputation, supplemented by interpolation to provide a seamless dataset that stands up to the rigorous demands of comparative international research. It has less columns and less countries to keep the integrity of the filled dataset."

In this project imputated data were used
